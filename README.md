# FoodEase, video for my project: https://youtu.be/TUuxkYufvoE?si=C-JXvewwTreh_mIR
The FoodEase app is designed to view dishes. Users can view a list of dishes with beautiful images, description, price and weight of the dish. Users can add their favorite foods to the cart and the app automatically calculates the amount of all selected dishes. 
The user can increase or decrease the amount of any food. 
The app has a Search page through which users can search for any food item.
The application automatically detects the user's current location and today's date, you can view this at the top of the main page(if it doesn't show up, simulate the location in Xcode manually, ex:Kazakhstan, Almaty).

I used the MVP architecture pattern.
Tools: CoreLocation, MapKit, SnapKit, CoreData, URLSession.
